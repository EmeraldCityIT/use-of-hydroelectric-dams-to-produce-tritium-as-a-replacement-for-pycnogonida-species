# use-of-hydroelectric-dams-to-produce-tritium-as-a-replacement-for-pycnogonida-species
Hydroelectric dams can be used to harvest fresh water, use hydro power to distill fresh water, split hydrogen, and introduce H1 to H2O to produce H30. No external power, or chemicals would be required. Hydroelectric power could power steam distillation or reverse osmosis. Hydroelectric power would be used to split H2. All machinery would be powered by Hydroelectric power. H2O source would come from same source as hydroelectric power reservoir. H2 would be extracted from same water source. This is a closed system which produces tritium without phage virus contamination, pycnogonida, or spider crabs.
